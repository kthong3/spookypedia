## Purpose:
We were tasked to take on a client-delivered project with several key features in mind.
Our client directed us to create a community forum/wiki for Halloween costume how-tos, ideas, and pictures.
They wished to make it very user-friendly, and wanted rich-text article composition and photo
uploading. We were tasked with allowing users to revert changes made to any article on the website, as
well as allowing any user to make changes to any article.

Our own goal was to explore Rails 5 and test-driven development as a group.
